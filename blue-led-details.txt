New set of 1000x blue colored 3mm wide angle PCB LEDs. Each diffused light emitting diode has a working voltage of DC 1.8v - 3.6v and a working current of 10mA. (1000) Blue LED 3mm Wide Angle Diffused 3V Light Emitting Diodes Bright Lamp PCB. Small size and super bright. Efficient and practical emitting diode lamp. Low heat, energy saving, low power consumption, long service life. Best replacement for traditional light sources. With applications for PCB board. Can also be used as light decorations, torches, toys & gifts, car decorations, light box advertising, signal indicator, and so on. Small size and super bright. Diameter: 3mm. Material: Epoxy resin + LED + Metal. Emitted Color: Blue. Working voltage: DC 1.8v - 3.6v (the longer pin is Anode). Working current: 20mA. Diameter: ~ 0.12inch / 3mm. Total length: ~ 30mm. These are not recommended for instrument clusters as they are too small. When error code or hyper flashing occurs, it means you need to add proper resistors. The shorter lead is NEGATIVE. The longer lead is POSITIVE. If installed wrong the LED will not light. You can easily check your board with a voltmeter or continuity tester to determine in which orientation to correctly solder them.
